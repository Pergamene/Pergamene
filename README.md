I've been a CS student at three Universities and while they teach the fundamentals of Computer Science: (problem-solving, performance optimization, data structures, and algorithms), they lack content relevant to today's internet-driven industry. I wish to change that by balancing a Computer Science focused education while still teaching modern web technologies, architecture, and development methodologies. 

In pursuit of that goal, I'm currently helping a medical startup create their web app. Which is giving me valuable industry experience as well as exposure to creating a startup and how to grow it into a successful business!
